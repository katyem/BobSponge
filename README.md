## Edit the index file - the primary content

Primary page info is in the "/content/_index.md" file under your primary folder.
Edit the file in your favorite editor (I use R-Studio so I can add R-markdown files to my site)


## Edit the Projects and/or Publications Folders

Under the \content foder you should see the other optional resume menu items. If you don't want them, delete the folder.  Otherwise, open the folder and make changes/copies where appropriate.

In /content/project/creations you'll find the folders of particular projects.  Copy one to a new folder with a name for your project. Change the image and the -index.md file. Once all of your projects are in the creations folder, delete the bobsponge folders.

In the publications folder, create a new md file for each of your publications and delete Bob's.

## Config x 2

Change the info in the config.toml file in your main project folder to reflect your information and settings:

```markdown

title = "BS CV"
baseURL = "https://bobsponge.netlify.app/"
theme = "hugo-resume"
languageCode = "en-us"
PygmentsCodeFences = true
PygmentsCodeFencesGuessSyntax = true
PygmentsStyle = "monokai"
enableGitInfo = false

[params]
address = ""
email = "bs@morebs.io"
favicon = "/favicon.ico"
firstName = "Bob"
lastName = "Sponge"
phone = ""
profileImage = "img/bob.png"
showEducation = true
showExperience = true
showOpenSource = true
showProjects = true
showPublications = true
showQr = true
showSkills = true

```

## Set up Netlify.com account using Github login

Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up or log in.
Click on New site from Git.
Select GitHub as the provider and authenticate if necessary.
Find and select your repository (i.e., BobSponge).
Netlify will automatically detect your build settings. You may need to specify the build command and publish directory if you're using a static site generator (e.g., for Jekyll, it might be jekyll build and _site).
Click Deploy site.

## Change the navigation menu

Go to the folder on your computer from the main project directory (i.e., BobSponge): "\themes\hugo-resume\layouts\partials\nav.html"
Move the "if" statements up or down. Moving Skills block of code below the Education block will change the order in the navigation menu.

```markdown

      {{ if .Site.Params.showSkills }}
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link js-scroll-trigger" href="/#skills">Skills</a>
          </li>
      {{ end }}

```

Please do not distribute any of the images associated with this project. If you use this as your template for your CV, go to the "static/img" folder and delete all of the images and replace with your own (hint, use the same image names, like qr-code.png, and you don't have to recode).

100% of my students who used this template landed a job!  She was really happy.
